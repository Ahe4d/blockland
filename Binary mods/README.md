# Ahead's Blockland GitHub

This directory is where I keep my modifications made to the Blockland executables if I decide to release them. For every modification there will most likely be both macOS and Win32 binaries. This will probably barely be updated.
No, I'm not releasing things that might prove to be malicious (not like I will anyway). Do it yourself.
